          Over the years, we saw how technology has become a huge part of our
          lives, even the simplest task we can do is now being done with the
          help of technology. Every person in the world must have at least one
          experience using technology in their daily life, whether it is for
          school work, workplace, or simply spending a normal day at home. As a
          first year student attending Cavite State University Gen. Trias City
          Campus, I can confirm that I use computer technology in order to
          complete various tasks, applying to the university’s admission,
          gathering information from my classmates or professor, and creating
          and submitting tasks. That’s only an example of what technology I use
          as a student, however if we want to see the effect of technology we
          need to consider all of the people from different working fields and
          institutions. So, let’s look at the technological advancement in
          today’s life and how it affects our environment and some of the major
          components of our society. And examine all of the possible effect of
          technology both positive and negative.

          Educational technology, education has become more accesible to
          everyone especially for those who have gadgets and internet. Because
          of the pandemic, felxible learning was implemented by the Commission
          on Higher Education under CHED memorandum No. 4. They provided various
          learning modalities such as offline, blened, and online learning and
          teaching. Offline learning modality uses mostly printed modules,
          television or radio broadcasting networks technology and online
          learning modality uses desktop computer, laptop, smarthpone, mobile
          applications or computer technology. While blended learning modality
          uses a combination of both. Broadcasting of learning modules through
          television and radio known as DepEd TV were created by the Department
          of Education with the Assistance of the Presedential Communications
          Operations Office (PCOO). In addition, access to information or other
          online resources (videos, blogs, forum) and books or physical media
          has been easier. With that being said, according to the article’s
          Teaching and Learning Continuity Amid and Beyond the Pandemic 2021
          results and discussion, students find that the learning activities
          were not flexible enough to be done either offline or online as they
          could not comply within the requirements within the expected schedule.
          As shown in the table below from the article.
        </p>

        <img src="./educational_images/table1.jpg" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          Not only that, majority of the students reported that they were unable
          to accomplish the tasks assigned by the teachers due to their
          inability to access the internet or use suitable gadgets to finish the
          tasks. As shown in the table below from the article.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="./educational_images/table2.jpg" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          To summarize, the various learning modalities are provided to continue
          the nation’s teaching and learning amidst the pandemic. It is also
          shown that students access to internet or gadgets could play an
          important role in their learning. Students inability to access such
          things will have no choice but to learn under the offline learning
          modality and therefore they will be limited to printed modules,
          television or radio broadcasting networks technology in their
          learning.

          Medical Technology, defined by The New Public Health (Third Edition),
          2014 as the application of science to develop solutions to health
          problems or issues such as the prevention or delay of onset of
          diseases or the promotion and monitoring of good health. Besides
          education, health or health care is also an important sector of
          society. A society wouldn’t be successful if everyone has an illness
          or sick. The health of everyone must be considered in order to run a
          properly functioning society. We are fortunate that Health care is
          also affected with the advancement of technology and as a result, we
          are currently benefiting from the advancements and receiving the best
          care that can be provided. According to Jahangir Moini in Health Care
          Today in the United States, 2023, Technological advancements have
          provided less-invasive surgeries, created more effective treatments
          for cancer, controlled infection better than before, and aided in
          healthier pregnancies and deliveries. And also, according to the
          book’s Table 1.2, it shows a lists examples of medical technologies,
          all of which are continually developing and advancing.

        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, we must keep in mind that these medical technology are only
          accessible to those who have money. According to (Jaymalin, 2019, p.
          3) 40 percent of 1,350 respondents from various parts of our country
          expressed uncertainty on their capability to pay medical bills. This
          means that most of the technological advancement in health care are
          not within reach by most Filipinos.

        <br />
        <p>
          As can be seen, health care along with education is also affected by
          the advancement of technology. In return, we as a part of the society
          are benefiting by being provided the best health care we can get with
          the aid of technology only for those who have high or upple middle
          income.

          Accroding to Knowledge, Technology and Complexity in Economic Growth,
          in economics, it is widely accepted that technology is the key driver
          of economic growth of countries, regions and cities. This is because
          of the manufacturing technology, it allows for more efficient
          production and better goods and services and in shorter amount of time
          in comparison to manual labor. According to (Okafor, 2020) on Negative
          Impact of Technology on the Environment, the manufacturing technology
          uses massive energy to turn the raw materials into the complex
          electronic or technological products that we use and not only that,
          the transportation of these products worldwide, by planes and
          automobiles, also contributes to the greenhouse effect responsible for
          global warming and air pollution. We can see that transportation is a
          big contributing factor in global warming and air pollution because
          according to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
          article Emission Reductions From Pandemic Had Unexpected Effects on
          Atmosphere, The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting limitations on travel
          and other economic sectors by countries around the globe drastically
          decreased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions within just a few
          weeks.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img width="600px" src="./medical_images/chart.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          And according to the same article, technology is mineral intensive
          that on average, around 35 different materials are used in
          smarthphone. One material is plastic, the second most used material
          after silicon. All of these materials are mined resulting to depletion
          of natural resources.

          alt=""
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          To sum up, technology is a key driving factor in economy but it is
          also a huge contributor to the greenhouse effect responsible for
          global warming and air pollution.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Lastly, the use of technology in other parts of our daily lives may
          not be as apparent because we are so used to it and forget that it is
          actually done through the use of technology such as gathering
          information online or from a book, communicating with other people
          through our smarthpones or just a mobile phone, playing games,
          watching movies or shows, and every other object we see must have been
          under some type of technology to get that final product.

        <p>
          In conclustion, technology has become an integral part of our lives.
          It has a great impact in our education, healthcare, environment, the
          economy and in our everyday activities. It has made education more
          accessible but mostly for those who have access to internet and
          gadgets. It provided a better healthcare, but accessibility still
          remains an issue for most. It is also a key driving factor for
          economic growth but also contributes to environmental issues. Overall,
          technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate,
          shaping our society in both positive and negative ways.
